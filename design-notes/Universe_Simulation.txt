RAW RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION (Underlying geology):
------------------------------------------------
These determine what Mining Output can be extracted and what uninhabited 
locations can yield if scanned:

- Based on system age, metallicity, and planet types
- Young systems: more volatiles and organics (better fuel, agricultural 
  precursors)
- Old systems: depleted light elements, more heavy metals (better mining 
  output)
- High metallicity: abundant industrial and rare resources
- Gas giants: helium-3 and deuterium for fusion (fuel production)
- Asteroid belts: concentrated metal deposits (mining output)
- Rocky planets: varied mineral composition (mining output)
- Ice worlds: water and volatile compounds (fuel, agricultural inputs)

Distribution Patterns:
- Resource-rich systems become mining hubs (10-15% of systems)
- Resource-poor systems serve as waypoints or administrative centers
- Some systems have unique monopoly resources (rare isotopes, exotic crystals)
- Resource scarcity/abundance drives colonization patterns
- Depletion over time in heavily exploited systems (mining output decreases)

ECONOMIC INTERDEPENDENCIES:
---------------------------
The economy operates on commodity flows between systems:

Core Industrial Loop:
- Mining colonies extract Mining Output → 
- Industrial worlds convert to Industrial Goods →
- All systems consume Industrial Goods for maintenance and growth →
- Cycle repeats

Food Supply Chain:
- Agricultural worlds produce Agricultural Goods →
- All inhabited locations consume (population needs food) →
- Prices high in barren systems, low in farm systems →
- Supply disruptions cause famines and unrest

Energy Economy:
- Refineries process gas giant resources into Fuel →
- All systems consume Fuel (ships, power generation) →
- Universal demand, stable prices, narrow margins →
- Strategic stockpiles critical during war

High-Value Chains:
- Tech Hubs produce High-Tech Goods →
- Consumed by advanced industries, military, research →
- Luxury Goods flow from Core Worlds to wealthy markets →
- Medical flows to all systems, spikes during crises

Black Market Economy:
- Weapons flow to conflict zones and military bases →
- Drugs produced in frontier labs, consumed everywhere →
- Blacknet Assets traded in digital underground →
- Extremely profitable but highly illegal

Economic Drivers:
- Trade routes emerge from supply/demand optimization
- Corporate control of key commodities creates bottlenecks and monopolies
- Economic booms from: new resource discoveries (Mining Output), tech 
  breakthroughs (High-Tech), new colonies (all commodities)
- Economic busts from: resource depletion (Mining Output drops), disasters,
  wars (disrupts all trade), blockades (cuts supply lines)
- Price volatility varies by commodity type

Supply and Demand Mechanics:
- Each system calculates: (Production - Consumption) = Net Export/Import
- Systems with surplus export at lower prices
- Systems with deficit import at higher prices
- Transportation costs increase with distance
- Risk premium added for dangerous routes (piracy, war zones)

TRADE NETWORKS:
---------------
Major trade routes connecting complementary economies:

Primary Routes (High Volume, Low Margin):
- Mining Output: Mining colonies → Industrial worlds
- Agricultural Goods: Farm worlds → Core worlds and mining colonies
- Fuel: Refineries → All systems (universal distribution)
- Industrial Goods: Industrial worlds → All systems

Secondary Routes (Medium Volume, Medium Margin):
- High-Tech Goods: Tech hubs → Advanced systems, military bases
- Medical: Pharma worlds → All systems (spikes during outbreaks)

Luxury Routes (Low Volume, High Margin):
- Luxury Goods: Core worlds → Wealthy systems, corporate HQs

Black Market Routes (Very Low Volume, Extreme Margin):
- Weapons: Defense contractors → Conflict zones, black market
- Drugs: Frontier labs → Freeports → Distribution networks
- Blacknet Assets: Hacker collectives → Syndicates, spies

Route Characteristics:
- Calculate shortest paths between complementary economies
- Weight by: commodity value, political stability, route safety
- Corporate control of lucrative routes (monopolies on key commodities)
- Piracy risk in poorly patrolled frontier systems (especially Luxury, 
  Weapons, Drugs)
- Trade disruption during conflicts reduces supply and increases prices
- Blockades can starve systems dependent on food imports
- Smuggling routes avoid customs and enforcement (higher risk, higher profit)

BLACK MARKET ECONOMICS:

Black Market Pricing:
- Legal commodity base price × illegal markup (2x to 10x)
- Weapons: 3-5x markup in civilian systems where they're illegal
- Drugs: 5-10x markup from production to street price
- Blacknet Assets: 3-8x markup depending on demand and rarity
- Stolen goods: 0.3-0.5x normal price (fenced at discount)

Black Market Locations:
- Freeports: Everything legal, market price (no markup)
- Hidden stations: Syndicate-controlled, moderate markup
- Corrupt officials: Bribes add 1.5-2x to transaction costs
- Frontier systems: Less enforcement, lower risk premium

Smuggling Economics:
- Transport fee: 20-50% of cargo value for illegal goods
- Risk premium increases with: cargo illegality, route danger, 
  enforcement strength
- Failed smuggling: Cargo confiscated, fines, imprisonment, or death
- Successful smuggling: High profits split between smuggler and client

Piracy Economics:
- Target selection: High-value cargo (Luxury, High-Tech, Medical)
- Stolen cargo fenced at 30-50% of market value
- Ransoms for ships/crew: 50,000 to 5,000,000 credits
- Protection rackets: 5-10% of trade route value annually
- Piracy increases insurance costs for all traders

Criminal Revenue Streams by Syndicate Type:
- Pirates: Ship captures (30%), protection rackets (40%), ransoms (20%), 
  fencing (10%)
- Drug Cartels: Drug sales (80%), money laundering services (15%), 
  enforcement services (5%)
- Cybercrime: Data theft (40%), ransomware (30%), blacknet sales (20%), 
  contract hacking (10%)
- Smugglers: Transport fees (70%), document forgery (15%), 
  brokerage fees (15%)
- Organized Crime: Extortion (30%), illegal gambling (25%), 
  weapons trafficking (20%), legitimate businesses (25%)

Route Generation Algorithm:
1. For each system, calculate net export/import by commodity
2. Find complementary pairs (exporter + importer of same commodity)
3. Calculate route profitability:
   Price_Difference × Volume - Transportation_Cost - Risk_Premium
4. If profitable, establish route
5. Assign controlling corporation (highest market share in that commodity)
6. Update route status each era based on:
   - War (routes through war zones close or become smuggling routes)
   - Piracy (unsafe routes reduce volume or increase prices)
   - Competition (multiple corps may service same route)
   - Supply/demand changes (new colonies, resource depletion)

================================================================================
SIMULATION ALGORITHM OVERVIEW
================================================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PROCESS:
-------------------

1. INITIALIZATION PHASE
   - Load configuration parameters
   - Initialize random number generator with seed
   - Load real star catalog data from CSV
   - Select 80-120 suitable systems within specified radius
   - Project 3D coordinates to 2D grid with scaling
   - Generate physical properties for each system (stars, planets)
   - Create faction entities with initial properties and ideologies
   - Create corporation entities with sectors and starting positions

2. ERA 1 SIMULATION (2100-2200)
   - Place initial colonies in nearest systems to Sol (Alpha Centauri, etc.)
   - Generate founding events and early exploration
   - Invent and deploy Generation 1 FTL technology
   - Simulate population growth in colonies
   - Initialize resource extraction and trade
   - Roll for random events (disasters, discoveries)
   - Record historical events and generate notable figures
   - Update faction and corporate relationships
   - Generate landmark events with proper names

3. ERA 2 SIMULATION (2200-2300)
   - Deploy Generation 2 FTL, expand colonization range
   - Generate faction divergence and territorial establishment
   - Expand to 40-70 systems total
   - Simulate first conflicts over resources
   - Create trade networks based on resource distribution
   - Roll for all event types (wars, discoveries, disasters, politics)
   - Simulate corporate growth and first mergers
   - Generate cultural drift in isolated colonies
   - Update populations, economies, and relationships
   - Record major historical figures and events

4. ERA 3 SIMULATION (2300-2400)
   - Peak colonization reaches 80-120 systems
   - Deploy Generation 3 FTL
   - Generate "The Great War" and other major conflicts
   - Simulate corporate consolidation and mega-mergers
   - Roll for all event types including rare ones
   - Some systems abandoned due to resource depletion or war
   - Technology diffusion across factions (with espionage)
   - Simulate refugee movements and migrations
   - Update all relationships and power structures
   - Resource depletion begins in heavily exploited systems
   - Record war heroes, tyrants, and revolutionaries

5. ERA 4 SIMULATION (2400-2450)
   - Minimal new colonization, focus on internal development
   - Deploy Generation 4 FTL as standard
   - Generate modern political landscape and cold wars
   - Simulate current conflicts and proxy wars
   - Roll for recent events (last 50 years of history)
   - Establish current state of all entities
   - Finalize trade networks and alliances
   - Generate current tensions and flashpoints
   - Record current leaders and notable figures
   - Some abandoned systems begin reclamation

6. POST-PROCESSING AND VALIDATION
   - Validate data consistency (no orphaned references)
   - Calculate final statistics (populations, economies)
   - Generate relationship matrices
   - Identify current tensions and opportunities for gameplay
   - Create trade route network
   - Verify historical cause-and-effect chains

7. OUTPUT GENERATION
   - Serialize all data to universe.json
   - Generate CSV files for game import
   - Write human-readable chronicle (summary.txt)
   - Render 2D star map visualization (star_map.svg)
   - Output statistics and generation report
   - Save seed and config for reproducibility

DETAILED ALGORITHMS:

Star System Generation:
1. Load real star data (position, spectral class, luminosity)
2. Filter by distance (within max_radius_ly of Sol)
3. Select random subset meeting min/max system count
4. For each system:
   a. Generate planets (count based on star type and age)
   b. Determine planet types (terrestrial, gas giant, ice)
   c. Generate moons for appropriate planets
   d. Calculate habitability scores
   e. Assign resource deposits based on composition
   f. Roll for special sites (abandoned stations, alien ruins)
5. Project 3D positions to 2D grid
   a. Use perspective projection or simple (x,y) with z-compression
   b. Scale to fit 100x100 grid
   c. Place Sol at grid center (50, 50)

Colonization Wave:
1. Start from Sol system
2. For each era, determine colonization range (based on FTL generation)
3. Select systems to colonize:
   a. Prioritize by: proximity, habitability, resources
   b. Factor in faction ideology (some seek habitable, others resources)
   c. Limit by available FTL technology range
4. Assign controlling faction
5. Generate founding date and circumstances
6. Initialize population (random within range)
7. Record founding event in history

Event Generation:
1. For each system/faction/corporation, roll dice against probabilities
2. If event triggered, determine type and severity
3. Generate details:
   a. Involved parties (people, factions, corps)
   b. Location (systems affected)
   c. Duration
   d. Causes (why it happened)
   e. Consequences (immediate and long-term)
4. Create proper event name following naming conventions
5. Generate or assign notable figures involved
6. Record in timeline
7. Update affected entities (relationships, resources, populations)

Relationship Evolution:
1. Start with initial relationship values
2. Each era, for each relationship pair:
   a. Apply base drift (random small changes)
   b. Check for modifying factors:
      - Shared borders (tension or cooperation)
      - Trade volume (improves relations)
      - Ideological compatibility (bonus or penalty)
      - Recent events (wars, treaties, incidents)
   c. Calculate new relationship value
   d. Check thresholds (alliance, neutrality, hostility, war)
3. If relationship crosses war threshold and circumstances permit:
   a. Generate war event
   b. Determine outcome based on military strength
   c. Assign territorial changes
   d. Update relationship to reflect post-war status

Technology Diffusion:
1. When technology invented, assign to inventor faction/corporation
2. Each era after invention:
   a. For each faction/corporation without tech:
      - Calculate adoption probability:
        * Base spread rate (open vs proprietary)
        * Relationship with inventor (good = faster spread)
        * Embargoes (reduce spread rate)
        * Espionage (chance to steal despite embargo)
      - Roll for adoption
      - If adopted, record date and update entity
3. Isolated systems may regress (lose technology)

Population Simulation:
1. For each inhabited location, each decade:
   a. Calculate base growth rate (births - deaths)
   b. Apply modifiers:
      - Economic conditions (boom/bust)
      - Conflict (war casualties, refugees)
      - Disease (plague deaths)
      - Quality of life (healthcare, education)
   c. Calculate immigration/emigration:
      - Push factors (leaving bad situations)
      - Pull factors (moving to opportunities)
      - Physical accessibility (distance, FTL availability)
   d. Apply total change to population
   e. Update demographics if significant migration

Trade Route Generation:
1. For each pair of systems:
   a. Calculate complementary resources:
      - System A has surplus of X, deficit of Y
      - System B has surplus of Y, deficit of X
   b. Calculate trade value (based on scarcity and demand)
   c. Calculate route safety (piracy, war zones)
   d. If value exceeds threshold and route is safe:
      - Create trade route
      - Assign controlling corporation (highest relevant market share)
      - Set volume based on populations and economies
2. Update route status each era:
   a. Increase volume if both systems growing
   b. Decrease or close if war or piracy
   c. Reroute around conflict zones

Historical Figure Generation:
1. Determine category (explorer, politician, scientist, etc.)
2. Assign to faction or corporation
3. Generate name (from name lists, culturally appropriate)
4. Assign birth date within era
5. Link to relevant events:
   a. Explorers to discovery events
   b. Politicians to wars, treaties, reforms
   c. Scientists to technology inventions
   d. Corporate leaders to mergers, scandals
6. Generate accomplishments based on linked events
7. Determine legacy and how they're remembered
8. Assign death date (or mark as alive if current era)

Landmark Event Naming:
1. Determine event type (war, treaty, disaster, etc.)
2. Apply naming convention:
   a. Wars: "[Location] War" or "The [Descriptor] War"
   b. Treaties: "Treaty of [Location]" or "[Location] Accords"
   c. Disasters: "The [Location] [Type]" 
   d. Discoveries: "The [Location] [Object]"
3. Ensure name is unique and memorable
4. Reference name consistently in all historical records
