# CX16_Space_Game
A space trading, exploration, and turn-based combat game for the Commander X16.

Command a small starship, ferry cargo between nearby systems, pick up missions, and upgrade your vessel while surviving turn-based skirmishes across the local stellar neighborhood. Core loops include:

- Docked mode for trading, outfitting, mission management, and briefings.
- Spaceflight navigation with fuel management and random encounters between systems.
- Turn-based combat that resolves weapon fire, maneuvers, and post-battle salvage.
